# Generalized Tic-Tac-Toe AI

## Project Description
This project implements an adversarial search agent for generalized Tic-Tac-Toe on an m×m board with k-in-a-row win condition using Minimax with Alpha-Beta pruning.

## Features
- Optimal play for 3×3 boards
- Alpha-Beta pruning for efficiency  
- Depth-limited search for larger boards
- Simple heuristic evaluation function
- Comprehensive test suite

## File Structure
- `game.py` - Game engine and rules
- `search.py` - Minimax, Alpha-Beta, and depth-limited search
- `test.py` - Test cases
- `main.py` - Game interface

## How to Run
```bash
# Run the game
python main.py

# Run tests
python test.py
